# Multi-Layer-Network-Infrastructure-Simulation-for-a-Campus-Environment
A simulated enterprise-level campus network designed using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project demonstrates a hierarchical network architecture with VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, and dynamic routing protocols, suitable for academic or corporate environments. Ideal for learning core networking concepts and practicing configuration skills.


## 📘 Project Overview

This project simulates a structured, enterprise-level **campus network architecture** using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is designed with a **three-tier hierarchical model** including core, distribution, and access layers. It demonstrates the deployment of essential networking components and protocols for a real-world educational or corporate campus environment.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- IPv4 Subnetting
- VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing
- DHCP Configuration
- Static & Dynamic Routing (RIP/EIGRP/OSPF as applicable)
- Switch & Router Configuration

## 🏗️ Network Features

- ✅ Logical segmentation using VLANs (e.g., Admin, Faculty, Students)
- ✅ Inter-VLAN communication via router-on-a-stick or Layer 3 switch
- ✅ Dynamic IP assignment using DHCP
- ✅ Hierarchical network model for scalability and manageability
- ✅ Proper IP addressing and subnetting strategy
- ✅ Connectivity testing using ping and simulation mode


## 📌 How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` file using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Review device configurations (switches, routers, PCs).
3. Simulate packet flow using the simulation mode.
4. Modify or expand the network as needed for learning or demo purposes.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of campus network design principles
- Hands-on experience with Cisco switch and router configuration
- Application of routing protocols and VLAN segmentation
- Practical experience in troubleshooting and testing networks
